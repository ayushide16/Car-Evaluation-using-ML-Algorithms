# Car Evaluation using ML Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project aims to evaluate cars using various machine learning algorithms, including models built with Gini Criterion, Entropy Criterion, and Artificial Neural Networks. The goal is to classify cars based on different evaluation criteria and improve the accuracy and reliability of car evaluations.

## Key Features
<ul>
  <li>Gini Criterion: Used for decision tree classification to measure the impurity of nodes.</li>
  <li>Entropy Criterion: Another approach for decision tree classification based on information gain.</li>
  <li>Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Utilized to build complex models that can capture non-linear relationships in the data.</li>
</ul>
